        <p>
            I'm Horn7x, a 15-year-old guy. I was born on May 14th, 2008, in Italy, but my parents are Moroccans.
            I started developing on June 6th, 2021. My journey began with Minecraft addons development, and later,
            I switched to game development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I've gained experience in various aspects of game development, exploring different
            technologies and frameworks. My passion lies in creating engaging and innovative gaming experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from coding, I enjoy exploring the gaming world, learning new techniques, and staying
            up-to-date with industry trends. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have
            any questions or collaborations in mind!
